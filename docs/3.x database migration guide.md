# Database migration guide to upgrade version to 3.x or later

This guide is required when upgrading the cloud chart from versions below 3.x to 3.x or later. The upgrade includes a breaking change in the PostgreSQL database image, transitioning from PostgreSQL 10 to the Bitnami PostgreSQL 14 image. Directly upgrading the chart version without migrating the database will cause the database pod to fail.

## Prerequisites

- Ensure you have `kubectl` and `helm` installed and configured.
- Verify access to the Kubernetes cluster and namespace.
- Confirm the PostgreSQL 10 database is running and accessible.

## Steps

1. **Run migration script and follow its guide**

Use the script `scripts/migration-postgres-10-to-14.sh` to create a backup of the PostgreSQL 10 database.

```bash
./scripts/migration-postgres-10-to-14.sh <kube_context> <namespace>
```

Replace `<kube_context>` with your Kubernetes context and `<namespace>` with the target namespace.

2. **Upgrade helm chart version (database reset)**

If you choose the option in script to upgrade the helm chart version, it will automatically reset the database. This is a breaking change and will delete the old PostgreSQL 10 instance and create a new PostgreSQL 14 instance.

If you do this manually rather than let script does, please see the required action in script message and follow the steps. After successfully launching new helm version, you can continue to run the script to restore the database.

3. **Restore the Database**

If you continue the script after helm version upgrade, it will automatically restore the database to the new PostgreSQL 14 instance.

4. **Verify the Migration**

Check the logs and verify the data integrity in the new PostgreSQL 14 instance.

## Notes

- The script retains the database dump locally for manual restoration if needed.
- Ensure proper cleanup of old resources after migration.
